# Work-Day-Planner
A simple but functional work day planner built using Bootstrap (v4.5), jQuery, and Moment.js.

## Description
This is a simple work day planner, built using a combination of Bootstrap, jQuery, Moment.js, and personal CSS.
Perfect for a busy professional needing to add important events to their schedule, this app provides timeblocks corresponding to regular business hours (9am-6pm),
with text-areas in each timeblock allowing for as many tasks to be added as the user might require.

Each timeblock includes a save button and a clear button to easily manage daily tasks and is color-coded depending on the hour of the day:

GREEN - for upcoming hours;
RED - for the current hour; and
GRAY - for past hours.

## Specs and Testing
